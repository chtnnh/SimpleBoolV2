SimpleBoolV2

This code is inspired by the work of @ialbert and @lujunyan1118.

It aims to bring SimpleBool to Python3 and further simplify its structure to help biologists with no prior experience in Python work with it. It also seeks to be maintainable for further development into multi value modelling.
